<p>TestIt is an add-on library for PHPUnit that extends mocking engine and
	allows comfort testing of class interactions with surrounding environment. Are
	you tired using
	$this-&gt;getMock()-&gt;expects()-&gt;method()-&gt;with()-&gt;will()
	constructions? TestIt is for you&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>Usual unit test consists from several steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>data preparation</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; prepare all data you'll need during
		the test. Input data, partial results (to return from mocked dependencies),
		expected results&nbsp;etc.
	</li>

	<li><strong>mocking of dependencies</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; creating of „fake“
		dependencies to not interact with the real environment during the&nbsp;test
	</li>

	<li><strong>creating new instance of the object to test</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; for every
		test new (clean) instance is necessary
	</li>

	<li><strong>expecting what should happen</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; defining expectations of
		dependencies calls and its behaviour (returning specific value, throwing
		exception&nbsp;etc.)
	</li>

	<li><strong>putting instance of tested object to the defined state</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;
		starting conditions are important for the test in order to be deterministic
	</li>

	<li><strong>calling method (methods) on testing instance</strong></li>

	<li><strong>asserting end conditions</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; asserting that all
		expectations are met, all results are as expected and test instance is in
		expected end&nbsp;state
	</li>
</ul>

<p>TestIt can help you with most of the steps.</p>

<h2 id="toc-installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Use <a href="http://getcomposer.org">composer</a> to install TestIt. Just add
	<strong>arron/testit</strong> project as your dependency.</p>

<h2 id="toc-testing-with-testit">Testing with TestIt</h2>

<p>TestIt offers own TestCase class that is inherited from
	\PHPUnit_Frame­work_TestCase and enhancing it with some features. It is meant
	to be base class for your tests. It is helping you with creating mocks of your
	class dependencies and verifying those dependencies are called as expected. To
	use this features, just inherit your test base class from
	\Arron\TestIt\Tes­tCase class and you are free to&nbsp;go.</p>

<p>The best way how to profit from this library is to integrate it to your tests
	so you will be able to use all those features even more easily.</p>

<p><strong>For examples, check examples directory.</strong></p>

<h3 id="toc-creating-of-the-object-to-test">Creating of the object to test</h3>

<p>There is abstract method createTestObject() defined in
	\Arron\TestIt\Tes­tCase namespace. It should return created instance ready to
	use for testing. So createTestObject() is the right place for any initialization
	mock injections etc. It will be called during the setUp call. So just
	concentrate on new object creation, the rest is in hands of TestIt :-) If you
	need to call any expectations about any dependencies called in the time of test
	object creation, overwrite <strong>inicializatio­nExpectations</strong> method
	and place your expectations there. This method will be called just before object
	creation in the setUp method.</p>

<h3 id="toc-mocking-of-dependencies">Mocking of dependencies</h3>

<p>TestIt is helping you with creating of mocked classes. It contains something
	like object locator so, it is not creating new mock every time. But you can get
	the best value if you integrate TestIt capabilities with your&nbsp;DI.</p>

<h4 id="toc-creating-mocked-class">Creating mocked class</h4>

<p>You create mock by simply call simple method in your test&nbsp;class:</p>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-var">$mock</span> = <span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;getMockedClass(<span class="php-var">$className</span>, <span
		class="php-var">$mockName</span>);</code></pre>

<p>Notice that all created mocks have to have unique name. With this name, you
	are referencing them in your expectations. It also allows you to have more mocks
	of the same class (with different names). Mock-creation engine uses native
	PHPUnit mocking, automatically mocking all public methods and adds call tracking
	feature. All you have to do is to pass the mock to your class you are testing to
	be called from&nbsp;there.</p>

<h4 id="toc-creating-mocks-of-global-functions">Creating mocks of global
	functions</h4>

<p>TestIt allows you to mock global functions. Do it by calling
	mockGlobalFunction function.</p>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-keyword1">protected</span> <span class="php-keyword1">function</span> mockGlobalFunction(<span
		class="php-var">$name</span>, <span class="php-var">$namespace</span> = <span class="php-keyword1">NULL</span>)

<span class="php-comment">//just call it before using global function
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;mockGlobalFunction(<span class="php-quote">'time'</span>, <span class="php-quote">'\YourNamespace'</span>);
<span class="php-comment">//and then expect the call
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;expectDependencyCall(<span class="php-quote">'global'</span>, <span class="php-quote">'time'</span>, <span
			class="php-keyword1">array</span>(), <span class="php-num">123456789</span>);</code></pre>

<p>Namespace argument is the namespace your time() function is called from. If
	not provided, it will be set to the namespace mockGlobalFunction is
	called&nbsp;from.</p>

<p>This is done by a namespace trick. If you are in namespace and call function,
	it will be searched first in the current namespace and then in the global space.
	So if not defined in the namespace, it will fall-back to global function.
	mockGlobalFunction will define mock of the function in specific namespace so the
	call will no longer fall-back to global space and mocked function will be
	called. Notice, that once the function is defined in some namespace, it will be
	called from anywhere in this namespace. Nevertheless TestIt will check and won't
	redefine it again. But in terms of readability of your code, call
	mockGlobalFunction everywhere you need it to be clear you are mocking
	something.</p>

<p>Therefore there is limitation here. You can mock only functions that are
	called with unqualified&nbsp;name.</p>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-var">$timestamp</span> = <span class="php-keyword2">time</span>();<span class="php-comment">//can be mocked
</span>
	<span class="php-var">$timestamp</span> = \<span class="php-keyword2">time</span>();<span class="php-comment">//can NOT be mocked</span></code></pre>

<p>There is one thing that is not working yet. Functions with output argument
	can be mocked but output argument won't work. The main problem is, how to detect
	output arguments? Any ideas?&nbsp;:-)</p>

<h3 id="toc-expecting-what-should-happen">Expecting what should happen</h3>

<p>In your tests, you are testing inputs and outputs, but you also have to test
	class interactions with its dependencies. Meaning you have to test, that there
	were correct methods called with correct parameters in correct order. These
	methods usually return some data so it is necessary to ensure, that this data
	will be returned.</p>

<p>In TestIt it is very easy to do so.</p>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-comment">//declaration of expectation method
</span><span class="php-keyword1">public</span> <span class="php-keyword1">function</span> expectDependencyCall(<span class="php-var">$dependencyName</span>,
	<span class="php-var">$methodName</span>, <span class="php-var">$methodArguments</span> = <span class="php-keyword1">array</span>(), <span class="php-var">$returnValue</span>
	= <span class="php-keyword1">NULL</span>)

<span class="php-comment">//practical use
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;expectDependencyCall(<span class="php-quote">"articleModel"</span>, <span class="php-quote">"get"</span>, <span
			class="php-keyword1">array</span>(<span class="php-num">10</span>, <span class="php-num">5</span>), <span class="php-keyword1">array</span>());
<span class="php-comment">//expects that on the "articleModel" dependency "get" method will be called with arguments (offset, limit) 10, 5 and it will return empty array
</span>
<span class="php-comment">//valid call in tested class would be for example
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;articleModel-&gt;get(<span class="php-num">10</span>,<span class="php-num">5</span>); <span class="php-comment">//where $this-&gt;articleModel is a property where mock named "articleModel" is stored</span></code></pre>

<p>Methods arguments will be expected to be exactly the same as you passed them
	(in the array). Empty array means no arguments, NULL means that you don't care
	so any arguments will be accepted. Optional arguments (with default value) can
	be omitted.</p>

<p>As for return value, all values passed here will be returned by mock call
	unchanged except instances of \Exception class (and its ancestors of course).
	These instances will be thrown as exception. It allows you to simulate cases
	where one of your dependencies&nbsp;fails.</p>

<h3 id="toc-defining-state-of-tested-object">Defining state of tested
	object</h3>

<p>Before launching the test, you must put tested object to defined state.
	Against this state you will assert changes after the test. In order to have real
	unit test, you shouldn’t use object's&nbsp;set methods etc. TestIt provides you
	two methods for this purpose.</p>

<h4 id="toc-setpropertyintestsubject">setPropertyIn­TestSubject</h4>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-keyword1">protected</span> <span class="php-keyword1">function</span> setPropertyInTestSubject(<span class="php-var">$name</span>,
	<span class="php-var">$value</span>)

<span class="php-comment">//example
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;setPropertyInTestSubject(<span class="php-quote">'state'</span>, <span class="php-quote">'notReady'</span>); <span
			class="php-comment">//will set property 'state' to value 'notReady' in test object</span></code></pre>

<h4 id="toc-getpropertyfromtestsubject">getPropertyFrom­TestSubject</h4>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-keyword1">protected</span> <span class="php-keyword1">function</span> getPropertyFromTestSubject(<span class="php-var">$name</span>)

<span class="php-comment">//example
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;getPropertyFromTestSubject(<span class="php-quote">'state'</span>); <span class="php-comment">//return value of the 'state' property in test object</span></code></pre>

<p>You can set/get any defined property from tested object. It is using
	reflection. I&nbsp;noticed random occurrences of errors here. I&nbsp;wasn't able to
	catch specific circumstances so far, but most of the time, it is working
	fine&nbsp;:-)</p>

<h3 id="toc-call-method-to-test">Call method to test</h3>

<p>Use getTestObject() method to access instance of test object. If not created
	yet, fresh instance will be created using the createTestObject() method.</p>

<p>From time to time, it can be useful to call/test also a protected/private
	method. TestIt provides you a simple method to call these methods.</p>

<pre class="php"><code><span class="php-keyword1">protected</span> <span class="php-keyword1">function</span> callTestSubjectMethod(<span
		class="php-var">$name</span>, <span class="php-keyword1">array</span> <span class="php-var">$arguments</span> = <span class="php-keyword1">array</span>())

<span class="php-comment">//example
</span><span class="php-var">$this</span>-&gt;callTestSubjectMethod(<span class="php-quote">'setState'</span>, <span class="php-keyword1">array</span>(<span
			class="php-quote">'ready'</span>)); <span
			class="php-comment">//will call 'setState' method with one argument 'ready',  even it is protected/private</span></code></pre>

<p>It is not a good habit to call inaccessible methods but it can be
	handy&nbsp;:-)</p>

<h3 id="toc-asserting-end-conditions">Asserting end conditions</h3>

<p>TestIt will automatically assert your expectations. For every dependency call
	these assertions will be done runtime (in this order):</p>

<ul>
	<li>correct method on correct dependency is called in correct order (defined by
		order of expectations)
	</li>

	<li>actual arguments of the method called are asserted against expected ones. If
		there is any of the methods arguments optional (with default value) and it is
		omitted, default value will be filled to the expectation.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of this assertion fails the test will fail immediately. Meaningful
	error message is generated, so it is clear what should have happened and what
	actually happened.</p>
